PPO V2
building upon V1, which seems to work well for some gaits
Trying to make bot more generic in V2

things to try:
1. make it learn to stand up if it falls
2. multidirectional control


Have tried these things in V1. didn't work well.
Need to make the training transition gradually from simple tasks
